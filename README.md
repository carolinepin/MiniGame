# MiniGame
first attempt at videogame, not balanced at all
improvements to make in the future:
have the cross roads show HP AND money as opposed to just money
make the town a whole do/while thing that the player can travel around without always needing to go to crossroads
show player money in shop so they know what to buy
create a levelUp() function in monsterBase class so that the level ups are more balanced/enemies get additional health
general balancing
